# Values
Go has various value types including `strings`, `integers`, `floats`, `booleans`, etc. Here are a few basic examples

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {

    fmt.Println("go" + "lang")

    fmt.Println("1+1 =", 1+1)
    fmt.Println("7.0/3.0 =", 7.0/3.0)

    fmt.Println(true && false)
    fmt.Println(true || false)
    fmt.Println(!true)
}
```

Strings, which can be added together with `+`.
Integers and floats.
Booleans, with boolean operators as you'd expect.
