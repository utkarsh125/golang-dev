# If-Else in Go
Branching with `if` and `else` in Go is straight-forward.

Here's a basic example.
```go
if 7%2 == 0 {
    fmt.Println("7 is even")
} else {
    fmt.Println("7 is odd")
}
```

You can have an `if` statement without an else.
```go
if 8%4 == 0 {
    fmt.Println("8 is divisible by 4")
}
```

Logical operators like `&&` and `||` are often useful in conditions.
```go
if 8%2 == 0 || 7%2 == 0 {
	fmt.Println("either 8 or 7 are even")
}
```

A statement can precede conditionals; any variables declared in this statement are available in the current and all subsequent branches.
```go
if num := 9; num < 0 {
    fmt.Println(num, "is negative")
} else if num < 10 {
    fmt.Println(num, "has 1 digit")
} else {
    fmt.Println(num, "has multiple digits")
}
```

**Note that you do not need parentheses around conditions in Go, but that the braces are required.**

_Sadly there is no ternary if in Go, you will need to use a full `if` statement even for basic conditions._
